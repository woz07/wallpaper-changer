# wallpaper-changer
A simple python script to change your windows wallpaper
> Note: This is only for windows, and only tested on windows 11

# How to install
- Go to release and download from the current version these 2 files; "data.json" and "main.exe", you can store them within any folder of your choice, I would recommend storing them in a folder called "wallpaper-changer-v1".
- Then after installing them just run "main.exe" and the program will ask you to input your wallpaper folder, this you must do accurately.
- It'll then display some options and that's how you know that it's been set up.
> Note: Incase you enter the wrong folder or perhaps just added an extra character or a mistake, you can change it by going into "data.json" in text editor and then changing the value of 'folder' to whatever wallpaper folder you want.
